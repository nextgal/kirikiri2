Changes in version 1.4.2 (x.x.2008)

 - Unified the handling of zwrite enable with transparent materials on all hw accelerated drivers. This means that all transparent materials will now disable ZWrite, ignoring the material flag.
   There is a scene manager attribute, though, which will revert this behavior to the usual SMaterial driven way. Simply call
   SceneManager->getParameters()->setAttribute(scene::ALLOW_ZWRITE_ON_TRANSPARENT, true) and set the SMaterial flag as desired.

 - Some changes for texture matrices in q3 shaders.

 - Added BlindSide's irrAllocator patch for proper TextureMatrix release under Win32 with any CRT library.

 - Added VC9 project files.

 - Added getEmitter for particle system scene nodes.

 - Fixed rounding problem in getScreenCoordinatesFrom3DPosition

 - Fixed Software renderer color flicker, was a shift bug I believe.

 - irrMap fix to make root node always black, by rogerborg.

 - Possible core dump fixed in particle system node, by CuteAlien.

 - Mem leak fixed in b3d loader.

 - Avoid double rendering of child nodes of joints.

 - Support for d3d draw2dimage clipping by CuteAlien.

 - Fixed an animation transition bug, pointed out by wuallen.

 - Fixed the major problem with OpenGL drivers, that claim to be 2.x compatible, but don't offer NPOT support (well, they do, but only in sw rendering...). Now we check for the extension string only.

 - Fixed .obj loader bug which inserted vertices in wrong buffers.

 - Fixed minor mem leak in Linux device.

-------------------------------------------
Changes in version 1.4.1 (04 Jun 2008)

 - MD3 meshes are movable again.

 - New JPG image writer version by Vitek.

 - Texture matrix fixes, all methods should now work as expected.

 - Some container methods now return the this pointer after member functions have been called on them, in order to allow call chains.

 - Some new methods for SColorf access, for uniform API of all colors.

 - bug fix for SMaterialLayer equality check. Did only check the TextureMatrix pointers, instead of the matrices.

 - New getMesh method for the SceneManager, which takes an IReadFile instead of a filename.

 - Support for flags _WIN32 and _WIN64 in addition to WIN32 and WIN64 added, this simplifies usage of Irrlicht headers under MSVC.

 - Fixed a crash in GUIMeshViewer

 - new string method findLastChar by Halifax

 - GUIEditBox got the 1 pixel shift after click fixed.

 - Some debug visualization has been fixed for skinned meshes

 - Undef PI symbol before declaring core::PI to avoid compilation problems

 - SAnimatedMesh now properly returns properties of Meshes[0] if those exist, such that it should be usable in place of an SMesh again.

 - Fixed 2d initialisation in opengl and d3d9 driver. This should fix problems with render states mixing up and distrubing, e.g. skin effects.

 - Avoid a crash when passing setSkin the current skin

 - Fixed current frame calculation for non-looped animations. Bug reported by greenya.

 - Fixed bug in CBillboardSceneNode::setColor, reported by rogerborg

 - Fixed clipping of menu, toolbar and combo box GUI elements, reported by greenya
   - setNotClipped now applies all the way up to the root of the GUI environment, rather than just to the next parent 

 - Made new scene managers use the original manager's GUIEnvironment, reported by MasterGod

 - Fixed IGUICheckBox::setEnabled, reported by Dorth

 - Fixed the FollowSpline animator to avoid crashes when only one waypoint is given.

 - OpenGL VolumeShadow now uses glPolygonOffset to avoid zbuffer artifacts.

 - Fixed meshbuffer corruption in append methods.

 - Fixed mem leaks in irrArray.

 - Fixed minor bugs in ISceneNode and ISceneManager.

 - Fixed the MeshCache handling of GeometryCreator meshes.

 - Terrain LOD bugfix.

 - Some Collada 1.3 loader enhancements and bug fixes.

 - Fixed a bug in CGUISpriteBank which caused a crash when a non-looping animated sprite reached the end of its animation.

 - Enhanced the .obj loader with the patch from ryanclark. This allows for recalculation of smoothed normals of the mesh, also should decrease the tri count on some meshes.

 - Avoid the global Logger to be destroyed too early.

 - Function setbit was renamed to setbit_cond to avoid name clashes.

 - Fixed .x animations with multiple references to the same joint from different meshes. Fixed texture path problems.

 - Support for Milkshape 1.8 files, also with multiple weights per joint.

 - The config file now also supports _IRR_OSX_PLATFORM_ and _IRR_USE_OSX_DEVICE_. This allows to use the Linux device (X11 support) on OSX.

 - Avoid terrain scene node crash when heightmap cannot be loaded.

 - Speed improvements for WaterSceneNode.

 - FlyCircle animator now also works for upvectors (Direction parameter) which are not (0,1,0). Is also faster now, since most calculations are done on init. Thanks to Dorth for working on this.

 - The 3ds loader correctly creates a texture matrix when texture tiling properties are found in the file.

 - Fix for S3DVertex comparison operators. Used some wrong logic.

 - Bugfix getCurrentRenderTargetSize in D3D drivers. Due to signature differences a wrong virtual method was chosen. Thanks to Jiang for finding it.

-------------------------------------------
Changes in version 1.4 (30 Nov 2007)

 - Major API change: All material properties which are available per texture layer (curently texture, texture matrix, texture filters, and texture wrap mode) are separated into a new struct SMaterialLayer. You can access them via the array TextureLayer[] in SMaterial. The texture matrix methods in SMaterial are still alive, and also textures can be accessed via methods in SMaterial now. But still, many places in user code need some update (usually changing material.Textures[i] to material.TextureLayer[i].Texture etc.)

 - Major API rewriting for proper const usage. Now, most getter methods are const and so are the larger parameters and return values. Moreover, many methods taking only unsigned numbers now use u32 instead of s32 in order to recognize this limitation from the method's signature.

 - the base class for nearly all Irrlicht classes has been renamed from IUnknown to IReferenceCounted

 - Fixed Skybox texture orientations. They are now displayed non-flipped. Existing skyboxes have to be changed, though: Exchange left and right texture. Textures from Terragen and other tools can be used directly, now. Quake maps will also need the right/left exchange.

 - Added ITexture::isRenderTarget()

 - Added STL mesh file format reader and writer.

 - Added IMeshManipulator::createMeshWelded which creates a copy of the mesh with similar vertices welded together.

 - Irrlicht now has its own file format for static meshes. It is based on xml and has the 
   extension .irrmesh. Irrlicht is able to write every IMesh to this file format, and of course to
   read it back again.
   
 - Irrlicht is now able to write Meshes out into files. Use ISceneManager::createMeshWriter()
   to obtain an interface with which you can write out meshes. Currently, an own .irrmesh
   file format is supported as well as the COLLADA file format.
   
 - fixed the keyboard autorepeat difference betwenn Linux and Windows. Thanks to denton we now have only KeyPressed events on both systems in case of autorepeat.

 - Added several new particle emitters and affectors from IrrSpintz. Also some new getter and setter methods were added.

 - D3D transparent materials do not disable zbuffer writing automatically anymore. This has to be done by the user to keep those settings configurable.

 - OpenGL texture now also require a regenerateMipmapLevels() after unlocking. This is the same as for d3d devices now.

 - Point sprite support in the driver. Point sprites use just one 3d vertex and a size to create a textured billboard on the GPU. This can provide fast particle systems, especially in combination with shaders. The proper particle extension will follow later on as it needs some more refactoring.

 - OpenGL 2D drawing accuracy fix by tuXXX

 - Added OnResize and getCurrentRenderTargetSize to the software video drivers.

 - Added Spot light type for dynamic lights. Note that both position and direction for all dynamic lights are now determined by the LightSceneNode, the SLight attributes are only used for internal purposes.
   API change! One can easily work around this change by setting the LightSceneNode's Position and Rotation instead of the SLight's. This change won't provoke a compile error, though, and can hence go unrecognized besides the visual problems.
   The lights use a default direction (0,0,-1) which is rotated by the usual scene node transformations and can hence be modified by scene node animators.
   A change in the Radius usage can lead to strange artifacts. Just increase the Radius in this case. further handling of Radius is to be discussed.

 - Added per pixel fog support for OpenGL.

 - Added driver support for user defined clip planes, based on mandrav's patch.
   The OpenGL version is more picky about ModelView matrices, so it's best to set the projection plane at the time it is used.

 - .obj files now load relative indices correctly. Collada files load textures.

 - A new MeshBuffer implementation is publicly available. It supports a shared vertex list for all MeshBuffers, used for MS3D meshes.

 - MeshBuffers can recalculate their BoundingBoxes on their own now, no need for MeshManipulators. New append methods help to merge MeshBuffers. take care that the types match!

 - The new texture generation mode is working. With ETCF_NO_ALPHA_CHANNEL textures are generated without ALPHA bits reserved.

 - D3D9 hardware mipmap updates are re-enabled, problems should be reported.

 - In some cases fullscreeen modes under win32 should have a better frame rate now.

 - Fixed the hillplane mesh to work with non-quadratic dimensions as well. Changed the interface also, so use a u32 dimension to specify the tilecount now.

 - Hires timers are disabled on windows systems with more than one CPU, due to bugs
   in the BIOS of many multi-core motherboards. To enable hires timers in your project, 
   use SetProcessAffinityMask to set to use only one CPU before creating the device.

 - OpenGL render targets now the same way up as the other drivers. If you have
   written opengl shaders that use render targets then you'll need to change your 
   texture coordinates accordingly.

 - Fixed some OpenGL renderstate stuff. setBasicRenderstate returns with
   active texture layer 0. The material renderer must return from OnUnset
   with the same active texture layer. The alpha test is disabled and the
   texture mode should be GL_MODULATE.

 - Fixed CSoftwareTexture2::getOriginalSize, reported by CaptainPants. Added a
   new method CSoftwareTexture2::getMaxSize to return the size of the largest
   mipmap, which is used by texelarea instead of getOriginalSize.

 - Changed parameter order of addArrowMesh and added default parameters such
   that it's enough to set the color (or even just the name).

 - Fixed bugs in MY3D and OBJ loader.

 - Added IMeshCache::clearUnusedMeshes(). This allows the user to remove 
   meshes that are sitting in the mesh cache but aren't used by any scene nodes. 
   This is useful for example when changing levels.

 - Added IUnknown::getReferenceCount()

 - createDevice now reports errors if the driverType is unknown, previously it 
   created a window but populated it with a null driver without any warning.

 - Fixed a bug in CBillboardTextSceneNode::setText where the old text was not 
   cleared.

 - Changed irrArray::linear_search to use the == operator rather than <
   This may be slower in some cases, but it no longer returns false positives
   when searching arrays of classes that override the < operator but 
   !(x<y) && !(y<x) does not necessarily mean x==y (vectors, positions etc).

 - Fixed getSize/getOriginalSize method inversion in OpenGL textures.

 - Added per texture-layer filter settings, i.e. one can choose to filter
   only chosen texture layers. If all layers are set to the same value the
   convenience function material.setFlag(EMF_BILINEAR_FILTER, boolean) can be
   used, TRILINEAR_FILTER and ANISOTROPIC_FILTER do work, too. In all other
   cases material.BilinearFilter[i] (resp. TrilinerFilter[i] or
   AnisotropicFilter[i]) shall are to be used.

 - Added adjustable Attenuation for dynamic lights. This allows to change the
   intensity of a light based on its distance. The default attenuation changed
   from (0,1/radius,0) to (1,0,0) which means no effect by distance. Good
   values for distance effects simply add small values to the second and third
   element.

 - Fixed a typo to do with 2nd light vectors in opengl parallax and normal map
   renderers.

GUI:

 - Fixes to menu and listbox (de)serialization, and custom listbox colors by CuteAlien.

 - Added EGET_ELEMENT_CLOSED GUI event type. Absorb this event to cancel closing a window.

 - Added _IRR_COMPILE_WITH_GUI_ to allow compiling without the GUI. 
   This is useful if you use another GUI system (ie CEGUI) or are using Irrlicht 
   inside another window. You will have to supply an external IGUIFont if you wish
   to use font scene nodes as there will be no GUI environment available to load fonts.

 - Added 7 more symbols to the built-in font and skin.
   EGDI_MORE_LEFT, EGDI_MORE_RIGHT, EGDI_MORE_UP, EGDI_MORE_DOWN: "<<" symbols
   indicating there is more content in that direction.
   EGDI_WINDOW_RESIZE: Window symbol for resizing by clicking the bottom right
   corner of a window.
   EGDI_EXPAND, EGDI_COLLAPSE: Plus and minus buttons for trees.

 - Added IGUISkin::draw2dRectangle, so skins can override the default highlight.

 - EGET_ELEMENT_FOCUS_LOST and EGET_ELEMENT_FOCUSED events can now be absorbed 
   by returning true in OnEvent. Absorbing these events will cancel the focus 
   change.

 - IGUIEnvironment::setFocus and removeFocus now return bools.

 - New SEvent.GUIEvent.Element. Points to a second element that is being 
   used in the event. During a EGET_ELEMENT_FOCUS_LOST event it points
   to the element which would like the focus.

 - Fixed the default font icons so they have a black border and are not 
   invisible in default listboxes. Old font tool textures now keep their color
   so colorful fonts are possible by editing the font's texture. The colors of 
   completely transparent areas are no longer kept when generating the texture
   from an image. Added builtInFont.bmp for ease of editing.

 - IGUIElement changes:

     Most elements can now be accessed using the keyboard. Use space and return
     to select or deselect, escape to cancel selection (ie while pressing a 
     button with space or return), and the cursor keys where appropriate.

     Added navigation through the GUI using tab and the shift and control keys.
     Use these new methods to control tab navigation:
       setTabStop - set this to true if the focus will vist the element.
       isTabStop - returns true if the focus will visit the element.
       setTabOrder - Sets the order of focus within this tab group,
         Only one element in each group should have the same TabOrder number.
         Set to -1 to add to the end of the group.
       setTabGroup - set this to true if the element is a group that contains 
         other elements, and can be navigated with ctrl+tab/ctrl+shift+tab.
       isTabGroup - returns true if the element is a tab group.
       getTabGroup - returns the tab group that the element belongs to.
       getNextElement - searches for the next element which would be focused 
         within the element's children, only useful if you are doing your own 
         custom navigation.

     Added isMychild, to check if an element is descended from this one.

     Added isPointInside, which is called by getElementFromPoint. Override this
     when making non-rectangular elements.

     OnEvent no longer absorbs events by default.

     Serialize/deserialize now call getter and setter functions, in case people
     override these and don't use the internal protected variables.

     added getAbsoluteClippingRect, returns the visible area of an element.

 - Added IGUISpinBox, by Michael Zeilfelder (CuteAlien).

 - IGUIEditBox new methods:
   setWordWrap/isWordWrapEnabled, to split words on to the next line.
   setMultiLine and isMultiLineEnabled, inserts a newline instead of sending
   EGET_EDITBOX_ENTER events.
   setPasswordBox/isPasswordBox to use the edit box for password input.
   setTextAlignment, to align the text to left, right, top, bottom and centers
   setAutoScroll, to enable and disable automatic scrolling with the cursor

 - IGUIStaticText new methods setDrawBorder and setTextAlignment.

 - IGUIListBox changes:
   Added setAutoScrollEnabled and isAutoScrollEnabled, for automatic scrolling 
   when selecting or adding an item. 
   Scrollbars are now only visible when the list doesn't fit in the visible area.
   You can now type an item's text to select it.

 - IGUIScrollBar new methods set/getLargeStep

-------------------------------------------
Changes in version 1.3.1 (20 Jun 2007)

 - Fixed a bug with negative exponents in fast_atof, posted by RVL

 - renamed IAnimatedMeshSceneNode::getAbsoluteTransformation to
   getMD3TagTransformation to avoid conflicts with
   ISceneNode::getAbsoluteTransformation

 - Added rect::constrainTo for locking a rectangle inside another without
   resizing it

 - Moved the OpenGL API functions from COpenGL driver into new extension
   handler. Thereby, some renaming took place - the ARB and EXT suffix was
   removed. Simply rename the functions in case you use them.

 - matrix4 is now a template internally such that also int and double matrices
   are possible now.

 - CMeshBuffer is a new template replacing all previous SMeshBuffer* classes.
   New mesh buffers can be easily implemented based on this code.

 - Ogre 1.40 files now also load.

 - New filename based methods in the MeshCache.

 - CSphereSceneNode is now texture wrapped with sphere mapping by exactly one
   texture. Only a small error on the top remained.
   
 - The Sky box scene node now clamps its textures by default (meaning no
   more ugly artifacts at the borders).

 - Frustum culling fixed by using the fixed classifyPointRelation function.

 - Some fixes in the 3d basic structures: plane3d.classifyPointRelation now
   correctly returns the relation, it returned the opposite before. Also
   renamed existsInterSection to existsIntersection for consistency.
   triangle3d.isOnSameSide is now private - it's just a helper class not
   intended for further use.

 - Added IFileSystem::getFileDir, to get the directory when given a file 
   name. Submitted by Jeff Myers

 - Updated to latest PNG library (1.2.18), fixing a vulnerability.
   Also changed some data structures which should make the library 64bit
   compatible.

 - Changed the external window pointer from s32 to void*. This makes the
   mechanism 64bit safe, but also breaks the API. You have to cast to
   void* now.

 - Moved image scaling algorithms to CImage class and made them public. This
   replaces lots of code from the hardware textures. It should also fix the
   missing MipMaps in OpenGL if the driver does not support mipmap generation.

 - Added support for texture creation flags in OpenGL. This changes some
   textures to other color formats than in previous versions.

 - MD2 normals fixed.

 - Some defines for the platform choice have changed their names and semantics.
   E.g. IRR_LINUX is now _IRR_LINUX_PLATFORM_ for os specific things and
   _IRR_USE_LINUX_DEVICE_ to choose the original X11 IrrLinux device.

 - Added an SDL device for cross-platform window support. Especially useful
   for embedded systems and others without hardware acceleration. This device
   is mutually exclusive with the other devices and requires linking against
   the SDL library.

 - Q3 shader crash fix.

 - Fixed the too small D3D texture bug.

 - The OpenGL texture is internally stored as a CImage now.

 - Fixed some Borland compiler problems.

 - ShadowVolume init bug fixed.

 - MS3D rotation bug fixed.

 - setFrameLoop bug fixed.

 - Fixed OpenGL's draw2DImage texture inits to avoid texture confusion.

 - Fixed getHeight from terrain scene node.

 - The FPS counter now works as in previous releases, the accumulating counter
   can be enabled by a parameter.

 - getType() is now const correct (API Changes)

 - Added scissor test to opengl draw2DImage method that ignored clip.

 - Fixed a bug in rect::isValid, it was almost always true.
 
 - Fixed wrong particle emission.
 
 - Added LinuxDevice setResizeAble implementation.
 
 - Enumeration values of the ESCENE_NODE_TYPE enum are no longer ints but four
   character codes. If you were using them as index previously, this is no longer possible.
 
 - There is now a way to set which scene manager should recieve user input, when working
   with multiple scene managers: IrrlichtDevice::setInputReceivingSceneManager().
 
 - ICursorControl now supports setting a reference rectangle.
   If this rect is set, the cursor position is not being calculated relative to
   the rendering window but to this rect. You can set the rect pointer to 0 to disable
   this feature again. This feature is useful when rendering into parts of foreign windows
   for example in an editor. See ICursorControl::setReferenceRect() for details.
   (Windows only implementation currently)

 - It is now possible to clone single scene nodes (ISceneNode::clone()) and to create copies
   of a whole scene graph (ISceneManager::createNewSceneManager(cloneContent=true);

 - IAttributes now supports a user pointer (void*)

 - Added query methods to scene manager: Find Scene nodes by type
    getSceneNodesFromType

 - Added min and max functions with 3 values: core::min_ and core::max_

 - Fixed a crash when using Octtrees caused by unnecessary dropping of meshes when 
   deserializing the scene node.

 - Removed an array::erase from Octtrees and Octtree triangle selector.
 
 - Removed a bug which caused irrlicht to crash when using animated .x files as static meshes.

GUI:

  - Added EGUI_DEFAULT_FONT for skins, default fonts can now be set for windows, menus, buttons and tooltips.
    use IGUISkin::setFont and getFont to use them. Fonts are not serialized with saveGUI yet

  - Added EGDC_TOOLTIP_BACKGROUND for setting background color of tooltips.

  - Tooltips now appear relative to mouse position, also they do not appear for 500ms.

  - Fixed a memory leak when dropping the GUIEnvironment when a tooltip was present.

  - Added IGUIStaticText::setDrawBackground and IGUIStaticText::setBackgroundColor.

  - Fixed a messagebox focus bug when no 'okay' button was present.

  - Added setColor and setScaleImage to GUIImage.

  - GUIListBox highlighted area now clips properly.

  - added getOSOperator to GUIEnvironment (for clipboard access in elements) and updated CGUIEditBox.

  - Can now load/save gui environment from/to an element.

  - Most element set functions now have a corresponding get or is function. 
   (API change) IGUIButton::getUseAlphaChannel is now isAlphaChannelUsed, to fit with other is* functions.

  - Fixed a bug with resizing the gui environment when the device is resized

  - Modal screens now resize to fit their parent.

  - XML bitmap fonts now load textures from the XML file directory rather than the current one.

  - Fixed a small bug with click areas in combo boxes.

  - Fixed a bug in clear() when an element was hovered or had focus

  - Fixed a bug when loading fonts with uppercase letters in the name in case-sensitive filesystems

GUI Editor:

  - Added cut/copy/paste using clipboard and xml (via memory file). Will have problems in Linux due 
    to no clipboard support

  - Added texture attribute element

  - Added CGUIPanel, a container with optional scrollbars. Originally submitted by Asger Feldthaus


-------------------------------------------
Changes in version 1.3 (15 Mar 2007)

- SMaterial structure changed:
   - Enable Irrlicht to change TextureAddress Mode (Clamping), for each layer separately
   - Added Texture matrices to SMaterial for all texture layers
   - Removed the anonymous union/struct access to textures and material flags.
	  Now, Texture1..4 is removed - use Textures[i] instead
	  The Flags[x] is replaced by setFlags(x, bool) resp. getFlags(x)

- The methods OnPreRender and OnPostRender of ISceneNode have been changed to
  OnRegisterSceneNode() and OnAnimate(). Also, they are now called at different
  times: OnAnimate is called every frame before anything else, removing the
  one-frame-lag Irrlicht suffered until now. To make most of your own scene
  nodes work again, it should be enough to rename OnPreRender()
  to OnRegisterSceneNode() and OnPostRender() to OnAnimate() in most cases.

- ISceneNode::getMaterialCount and getMaterial now use u32 instead of s32. You will also need 
  to update this in your custom scene nodes.

- matrix4 speed enhancement, testing for identity before multiply. faster check for identity
  for the positive case using an additional boolean flag.
  The internal array M is now private, changing the API. Use mat[x] instead of mat.M[x].
  The pointer to M is acquired by mat.pointer(), some methods take a matrix4 reference 
  instead of a f32*.

- Some more suppport for tangent meshes

- Several alpha blend fixes in several drivers and methods

Font improvements:

  - Changed built-in IGUIFont to IGUIFontBitmap and added options for more fonts.
    CGUIFont now supports UCS-2 and may span many textures, loads from XML (Unicode support planned)

  - Started a font tool for creating the new XML fonts, including generating vector fonts
    (currently not backward compatible with old fonts, only works for Win2K+, some bugs still)
   
  - Font interface now supports kerning- kerning pairs, per letter and global kerning widths, 
    although he internal font only supports global and per-letter.

  - added _IRR_COMPILE_WITH_SOFTWARE_ and _IRR_COMPILE_WITH_BURNINGSVIDEO_ to compile config


- GUI enhancements:

  - GUI Serialization with loadGUI and saveGUI, and serializable custom GUI elements via factories

  - Started a GUI Editor as a GUI element factory example (work in progress)

  - New IGUIElement functions: isSubElement & setSubElement for child elements created by their parents 
    (eg. a scrollbar on a list box). Set it if you don't want an element to be serialized

  - New GUI event, EGET_ELEMENT_FOCUSED

  - GUI environment ELEMENT_FOCUS_LOST event now sets the element as the caller, focus_lost events 
    are now usually passed to parent elements, so elements now check if they are the caller before 
    updating (so users can catch focus lost events without them being eaten by the elements)

  - Buttons, checkboxes and tab controls now only activate when the mouse is released over them.

  - Windows mouse-up events are now caught outside the window, so mouse coords may now be negative.
    could cause problems with draggable user windows, as they may now be dragged off screen.

  - Elements can now automatically resize to fit their parents, or align themselves to an edge:
    setAlignment(left, right, top, bottom) - sets how each edge aligns to its parent, 
    through EGUI_ALIGNMENT enum
    EGUIA_UPPERLEFT - default behaviour, aligns to top or left edge
    EGUIA_LOWERRIGHT - aligns to the lower or right edge
    EGUIA_CENTER - moves relative to the center of its parent
    EGUIA_SCALE - uses relative scale

  - setMaxSize, setMinSize - sets the maximum and minimum sizes for automatic resizing, 
    use 0 for no maximum size.

  - setRelativePosition now takes a rect<f32> for relative positioning within their parents

  - getFileSystem added to the GUI environment

  - New IGUISpriteBank, used to hold 2d image data like fonts and GUI icons. 
    Icons provided by the built-in font are now accessed through the skin's sprite bank.
    Users can override the icons by setting a different sprite bank and setting new sprites.

  - Skins are now serializable and are loaded/saved with the GUI.

  - IGUIStaticText getter/setter functions patch by rogerborg.

- added 3d TextSceneNode2. to view a Text in real 3D Space
   in fact it is a combination of Billboard & TextSceneNode

- Burning Video (the second but only complete software renderer)
  - New Compile Config BURNINGVIDEO_RENDERER_ULTRA_FAST
  - New Compile Config BURNINGVIDEO_RENDERER_FAST
	touching the 20fps border in the demo ( P4 mobile 2Ghz ). 15fps average.
	( Compile config Release Fast-FPU )
		
  - VertexCache for Tansformed & Light Vertices
    boost small drawPrimitive Calls ( 2DRectangle, Billboard ) and Real Index Triangles
		
  - Bilinear Dither
  - clipping test ( compare instead of generic plane normal )
  - support for NOT using vertexcolor
	#define SOFTWARE_DRIVER_2_USE_VERTEX_COLOR

- added vertex to color to billboard.
	shade top & shade down.
	to support some static lighting effect on billboards
 
- Implemented line rendering for SoftwareDriver

- XMLWriter fix for 32bit wchar_t (esp. for big endian)

- updated to latest PNG library

- implemented CImagerWriterJpeg::writeImage

- The ISceneManager::addCameraSceneNodeFPS() has a new parameter named 'jumpSpeed'
  and a Key Map Entry.

- added param to IIImageWriteFile::writeImage
	control Parameter for the backend ( e.g. jpeg compression level )

- addContextMenu: CGUIEnvironment::addContextMenu set the focus on the submenu.

- Added IFileSystem::createMemoryReadFile for accessing memory like a file.

- Added core::map class submitted by Nastase Catalin (Kat'Oun)

- Fix vertex colors for .x and .ms3d, alpha bug in .obj

- Fixed 16bit depth screens under Windows.

- Implemented getMeshBuffer(SMaterial) for all AnimatedMeshes. 
  It was returning 0 for all implementations previously. User defined IMesh derivates
  will also have to implement it now due to the removed empty implementation.

- Added yield() method to IrrlichtDevice which allows to pause the Irrlicht process for
  a very short time. This allows other processes to execute without a major
  penalty for the Irrlicht application.

- Added sleep() methd to IrrlichtDevice, for pausing the Irrlicht process for a longer 
  amount of time.

- Auto-split mesh to 16bit buffers in 3ds loader

- 8bit RGB332 image format support

- isActive() under Linux now behaves like the Windows variant: True iff window has focus

- Fixed(?) the glXGetProcAddress problems with different drivers

- B3D changes by Luke: 
  Texture scaling bugfix, support for alpha blending, new option to normalise weights, 
  animation code optimization, fixed memory leak

- ROUNDING_ERROR is now ROUNDING_ERROR_32 or ROUNDING_ERROR_64

- Material ZBuffer flag changed to a u32 value 
  Reason: change ( off or on ) to , off, lequal, equal
  Necessary for multi-pass if previous stage has had transparency

- DebugDataVisible is now an enum of flags
  show normals is supported ( uses the new build in arrowmesh )

- New Function: GeometryCreator
  addArrowMesh. build a closed cylinder and a cone
  used to show normals as debug feature

- New Function:
  CMeshManipulator::transformMesh(scene::IMesh* mesh, const core::matrix4& m) const
  transforms VertexPosition and VertexNormal

- BUGFIX: CGUIButton notified Pressed when Mouse was clicked Inside ( correct )
  but also left up outside rectangle ( incorrect)

- BUGFIX: Octree:getPolys(const scene::SViewFrustum& frustum, SIndexData* idxdata)
  was recursive calling invisible children

- CFileList: Changed FileListEntry sorting to
  a) Directory comes first
  b) sorting ignores case
  so it feel's more like common browers

- added a Texture transform to IVideoDriver::setTransform
	
- quaternion::getmatrix
  in fact the getmatrix version is returning the transposed.
  i'm quite sure that this is the wrong implementation.
  so this should be verified to remove the getmatrix_transposed version...

- Quake3 Map Loader:
  new loading method
  - Bezier Patches with LOD more than 3
  - Multiple Meshes, stay compatible with the previous version
  - Indexed Triangle List
  - initial support for quake3 Shaders and Entities
  - Shaders are parsed. When it's possible to resolve a 2 Texture Scheme it's taken
 	Shaders exist in namespace scene::quake3
  - The Example Quake3Map shows how to continue applying the Q3Shaders with SceneNodes
     ( for example animmap converts to TextureAnimator.)
     TODO: use the Irrlicht Variable Syntax to remove redundant code..
	   
- added getVertexPitch() to IMeshBuffer interface

- added generic isupper, isspace.. functions to coreutil.h to remove dependencies for ctype.h
   ( future: it's possibly to use binary comparison test..)
  removed 1000's include of string.h and moved one to irrstring.h
  in preparing of complete removing the MSVC.

- moved fast_atof.h to the public include
  added strtol10 to remove dependencies for stdlib.h
  anyway math.h is needed for powf
	
- core::vector3d
  added getInterpolated_quadratic.
  vector3d<T> getInterpolated_quadratic(const vector3d<T>& v2, const vector3d<T>& v3, const T d) const
  // this*(1-d)*(1-d) + 2 * v2 * (1-d) + v3 * d * d;
	
- irrstring: added param start to findLast(T c,  s32 start = -1 )
  reason: to continue searching reverse on a specific position
  (parameter is checked against boundaries )

- added operation reciprocal_squareroot to irrmath.
  core::reciprocal_squareroot = 1.f / sqrtf ( x )
  changed the core::vector3df normalize vector.
  specialized templates are not allowed in irrlicht currently, so it's only for f32 for now.
  a C function and a NVidia Version are in irrmath.h
	
- add Primitives to CFPSCounter 
  and changed interpolation to 1500ms instead of 2000ms
  and rounding to ceiling..

- added Interface setAmbientLight to ISceneManager
  it was a Bug, because SceneManager always calls Driver therefore AmbientLight has to be set in SceneManager.

- changed GUIFont & FontTool to support kerning ( on a global basis )
   very basic mode.. apply an offset for position
   useful for example if you want to apply an outline stroke in your favorite
   and therefore let the texture grow.
   and to correct the border back on drawing, specify the parameter in IGUIFont.
   this is quite useful if you want to use more artistic fonts.
   default = 0
   better kerning would need a seperate coordinate set for each symbol.
	
- changed MD2_FRAME_SHIFT to lower framerate
	-> lower IPol
	problems can occur if somebody uses hardcoded frame-numbers instead
	of Animation name...

- changed spelling "frustrum" to "frustum"
	-> changed also SViewFrustrum.h to SViewFrustum.h
	
- changed Parameter AutomaticCulling from bool to enum E_CULLING_TYPE
	to support more than two culling modes.
	
	added Frustum culling ( it's a copy & paste from the octree )
	added initial bounding sphere
		used for culling point lights..
	 
- Added getSystemMemory and getProcessorSpeedMHz for Windows and Linux to the OSOperator, submitted by Vitek.

-------------------------------------------
Changes in version 1.2 (29 Nov 2006)

- Added Solaris/Sparc port (basically some compiler define statements). Irrlicht and the examples should compile out-of-the-box on Suns with the usual Makefiles and gnumake.

- Added texture matrix support for hardware accelerated drivers. This allows for efficient texture coord manipulations for complete meshes at once.

- Multisampling with OpenGL under Linux added

- Non-power-of-two textures are left unscaled if the driver supports such textures.

- new draw2DImage method that speeds up drawing many quads from the same texture. Font drawing is improved by this under OpenGL.

- TGA files are now always correctly flipped and loaded if compressed. All PNG color formats are now supported, including correct alpha handling.

- 3ds mesh loader fix in texture loading, now loads some textures that were not loaded before, but might introduce problems with very recent files. OGRE mesh loader bugfixes and lightmap support. Several B3d mesh loader updates. Obj and mtl loader enhancements.

- A new compile flag (IRR_OPENGL_USE_EXTPOINTER) allows Irrlicht to either use OpenGL extension function pointers or direct OpenGL calls.

- OpenGL now uses frame buffer objects for render targets larger than the screen, supplied by Mandrav

- Split ESNRP_LIGHT_AND_CAMERA passes into ESNRP_LIGHT and ESNRP_CAMERA to fix a problem with lights being rendered before cameras in OpenGL (thanks again to Vitek for finding this). ESNRP_LIGHT_AND_CAMERA is now deprecated.

- Fixed many OpenGL render state problems which were related to wrong texture states. The textures are now enabled and disabled by the material renderers in OnSetMaterial. Also enabled the texture state cache which helps preventing texture changes just as the one for D3Dx. Thanks to hey_i_am_real for some good hints on where the problem was located. 

- Added compile flag _IRR_COMPILE_WITH_X11_ which is by default enabled. Disabling the flag removes all X11 dependencies from Irrlicht and allows for a headless Linux Irrlicht server - added by request :-)

- Win32 OpenGL driver tries to use the requested bpp size.

- Default texture format is now A8R8G8B8 if not explicitly specified. This fixes some color artifacts with lightmaps. Bugfix submitted by hey_i_am_real.

- In OnPostRender all transformations were taken as relative and multiplied with the root transformation matrix every time due to a wrong check for the real root node. This shoudl increase render performance for scenes with lots of (invisible) nodes.

- Added correct list copy constructor.

- Color selection dialog added.

- New GUI skin "Burning Skin".
	it's a black & white skin. look elegant on true-color.
	and looks ok on 1-Bit ( e.g. no vertex color in burnings video )

- GUIStatic text is correctly grayed out if disabled.

- Added getHeight method for terrain node submitted by Spintz. It calculates the height from the base mesh instead of requiring ray casts and collision detection and is much faster.

- New methods core::lerp to linearly interpolate two floats and SColor.getLuminance to calculate luminance of RGB color.

- MAJOR API CHANGE:
  Fixed matrix access methods mat(x,y). These were previously said to be (row,column) but actually were (column, row). This lead to some confusion and made their use quite tricky. Irrlicht code is updated for the new method, but applications will silently fail now (i.e. compile without errors, but not working as expected).

- Update to zlib-1.2.3

- Fixed vertex alpha handling in DirectX drivers.

- Image writers fixed and working (at least for little endian systems).

- VSync under Linux fixed and correctly working.

- New os::Byteswap::byteswap methods which can be used for byteswapping (endianess correction) in mesh loaders and image loaders.

- New video driver feature to check for multitexture feature.

- Direct3D drivers update the devicelost variable if reseeting failed with this return code.

- VideoModeList under Linux is correctly filled now. No glX calls are made if GLX extension is not found - only software drivers are available then. RandR extension can be enabled with a new compile flag in IrrCompileConfig.h, either instead of XF86VidMode or in addition.

- Big Endian support for MS3D loader.

- Apfelbaum software renderer: basic mipmap support (per triangle), switch for using w-buffer instad z-buffer ( default on )

- Better FPU support: Changed various fpu-call's in whole project (main reason to use faster float to int conversion on x86. ( fistp ))

- changed Visual Studio 7.1 vcproj project config "Release Fast FPU" to __fastcall in /QIfist

- CGUIFont added True Alpha Font Support. (currently it's a little hack, but it'a good starting point. Fonts are back compatible. To use the new feature make first pixel half transparent in the font file.)

- Scolor: replaced s16 color with u16 color, replaced s32 color with u32 color to get rid of unnecessary arithmetic shift

- Colorconverter: X8R8G8B8toA1R5G5B5, set Alpha High, minor: A1R5G5B5toA8R8G8B8 	changed if (a) to conditional set

- CImage: added boxfilter (weigthed average), (generic, slow)

- The scene manager now sets an ambient light color when calling ISceneManager::drawAll().
  You can influence this by calling ISceneManager::setAmbientLight(). That light color
  is also stored when saving .irr files via ISceneManager::saveScene().

- Loaded COLLADA files which contained only one single mesh now behave like all the 
  other loaded meshes, and the #meshname workaround has been removed.

- File lists are now sorted.

- Dynamically checking the OpenGL version now instead of at compile time to call the supported methods of the executing machine, not that one of the compile host. This should fix the extension check and the automatic mipmap update.

- Fixed vertex alpha handling of 2D images with OpenGL.

- Default depth buffer under Windows now 24bit to avoid zbuffer fighting.

- Fixed light count in OpenGL.

- Particle emitters can now be enabled/disabled via a new method.

- Sky dome is rotatable just like the sky box.

- Rotation animator can be applied to several nodes now, before it only rotated the first one it was applied to.

- Support for drawing other vertex primitive lists such as triangle strips.

- Default specular color is white again, thus simply enabling shininess is enough to get speculars.

- Some .x loader and animator improvements. Vertex color support.

- isActive now also work under Linux.

-------------------------------------------

Changes in version 1.1 (06 Aug 2006)

- New example to show some features of the .irr format

- Added support for making screenshots in all video drivers and a general
  possibility to save any IImage to several file formats.
  Some image writers are not yet implemented. As a testcase screenshots
  are now available in the demo by pressing F9.
  This code was contributed by Travis Vitek.

- Changed EAMTS_OCT to EAMT_OCT.

- Improved .3ds and .obj file importers.

- Added support for .b3d (Blitz Basic) submitted by Luke Hoschke and
  .pak (Quake archive) files submitted by skreamz.

- Added sky dome implementation contributed by Anders la Cour-Harbo (alc).

- In addition to the Cube scene node (formerly test scene node) there is now also a sphere scene node available,
  with an adjustable amount of polygons. Use ISceneManager::addSphereSceneNode to create it.
  Thx to Alfaz93 for making available his code on which this node is based on.
  Note that both nodes now use default material settings, e.g. lighting is enabled by default.

- Fixed Linux keyhandling for many keys.

- The aspect ratio has been inverted in the matrix, which means when setting a new aspect ratio
  for cameras, set it to screen.width/screen.height now instead of screen.height/screen.width
  as previously.

- added support for reading/importing binary .x files.

- .ms3d and .x normals are now correctly transformed in animations, bounding
  boxes are slightly better transformed, but not yet correct.

- Added possibility to load and save Irrlicht scenes to and from xml files via
  ISceneManager::saveScene and ISceneManager::loadScene. Note that not all
  scene nodes are supported yet, but most features should already work.

- Bounding box of the Skybox corrected (set to null)

- The SMaterial structure now supports 4 textures. (Currently ignored by the renderers and their materials.)

- Test scene node renamed to CubeSceneNode.

- Added scene node animator factories. This is the same as scene node
  factories, but for scene node animators.

- Added scene node factories. This is an interface making it possible to dynamicly
  create scene nodes. To be able to add custom scene nodes to Irrlicht and
  to make it possible for the scene manager to save and load those external scene nodes, simply
  implement this interface and register it in you scene manager via ISceneManager::
  registerSceneNodeFactory

- Introduced IMeshSceneNode interface with the possibility to set readonly materials to make
  it possible to use the mesh materials directly instead of overriding them. In this way
  it is possible to change the materials of a mesh causing all mesh scene nodes
  referencing this mesh to change, too.

- Added possibility to load OGRE .mesh files directly, thanks to Christian Stehno who contributed
  a loader for this.

- Merged with Irrlicht 1.0 for MacOS

- Added a method getType() to ISceneNodeAnimator.

- There is now a system to serialize and deserialize attributes of scene nodes. In this way
  it should be quite simple to to expose the attributes of your scene node for scripting
  languages, editors, debuggers or xml serialization purposes.

- Irrlicht containers and strings now have allocators, making it possible to
  use them across .dll boundaries.

- Changed the name of scene nodes from wide character to to char* for speed and memory reasons.

- Renamed IStringParameter class to IAttributes and enhanced it to be able to
  serialize its content into and from xml.

- Textures now have a method getName().

- Added the methods getTextureCount() and getTextureByIndex() to IVideoDriver.

- Most classes now derive virtually from IUnknown.

-------------------------------------------
Changes in version 1.0 (19 Apr 2006)

- Irrlicht now will load d3d 9 dlls (like d3dx9_27.dll) manually if needed. If you compile irrlicht
  with an SDK which needs one of these dlls, irrlicht will now also start up on a pc without
  these Dlls installed. Note that now these dlls will also only be loaded if your application
  uses shaders. If the dlls are missing, shader support will be disabled.

- The Apfelbaum Software Software Renderer now works in 32 bit and is capable of rendering dynamic
  lighting as well as doing alpha channel blending.

- Added support for the Code::Blocks IDE (http://www.codeblocks.org)

- It is now possible to draw temporarily to foreign windows, by specifying a window handle when
  calling IVideoDriver::endScene(). Note: This does not work in fullscreen mode and is not
  implemented for all devices (only for	D3D8, D3D9, Software1 and Software2, and only for Windows).
  In addition, you can also specify the source rectangle to present.

- Picking is now more accurate and also works with view ports and better with orthogonal cameras.

- Scene Nodes now have an additional flag, IsDebugObject. This denotes if a
  scene node is a debug object. Debug objects have some special properties,
  for example they can be easily excluded
  from collision detection, picking or from serialization, etc.

- Scene Nodes now have the possibility to return their type using
	virtual ESCENE_NODE_TYPE getType().

- Improved support for orthogonal rendering: Skyboxes and billboards can be
  used with orthogonal cameras now, too.

- Fixed a bug in collision

- Fixed some marshalling bugs in Irrlicht.NET

- Some fixes to make gcc 4 happy.

- Fixed a bug which caused the engine to crash when trying to use the
  apfelbaum software rasterizer with linux

- Several improvements to Irrlicht.NET, for example string output for vectors, viewfrustrum access
  for cameras, drawing of bounding boxes, support for orthogonal cameras.

- Updated DMF importer to support new DeleD functionalities, solid materials will now be
  shown correctly again in Irrlicht.  Thanks to Salvatore "Il Buzzo".

- Added a method to change the return value of ICameraSceneNode::isOrthogonal

- Improved md2 animation playback

- Fixed the REFLECTION_2_LAYER materials. Now also works for OpenGL. Had to change the parameters
  of this material (for all drivers), the reflection is now at texture 2 and the diffuse map at
  texture 1. This was the other way round before.

- Added examples for csharp, visualbasic, delphi.net and boo.

- Several other small bug fixes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 0.14.0 (30 November 2005)

- Irrlicht now includes another video driver type. Together with D3D8, D3D9, OpenGL, the NULL
  driver and the Software Renderer, an Irrlicht user now has the decision between 6 renderers:
  The new included renderer is The Apfelbaum Software Renderer, an alternative software renderer
  for Irrlicht. Basically it can be described as the Irrlicht Software renderer on steroids.
  It rasterizes 3D geometry perfectly: It is able to perform correct 3d clipping, perspective
  correct texture mapping, perspective correct color mapping, and renders sub pixel correct,
  sub texel correct primitives. In addition, it does bilinear texel filtering and supports more
  materials than the EDT_SOFTWARE driver. In short: It looks a lot like the already available hardware
  accelerated drivers, but without hardware. :) This renderer has been written entirely by
  Thomas Alten, thanks a lot for this huge contribution.

- Irrlicht now supports anisotropic filtering. Use the SMaterial::AnisotropicFilter member or
  EMF_ANISOTROPIC_FILTER flag to enable it. I implemented this for all 3 hardware accelerated
  drivers: D3D8, D3D9 and OpenGL.

- Irrlicht now supports the recently released new microsoft compiler. Irrlicht versions compiled
  with older verions of this compiler can now also be used with the new one, which wasn't possible
  previously because of a name mangeling issue.

- All 2D drawing functions can now be used to draw into textures (render targets). This also
  means for example that the whole GUI environment can be rendered into textures.

- Irrlicht.NET now supports shaders.

- Irrlicht now loads all textures in 32 bit mode by default. (Previously this
  was 16bit). To change this behaviour back again, use
  device->getVideoDriver()->setTextureCreationFlag(ETCF_ALWAYS_16_BIT, true);

- Irrlicht.NET now supports Particlesystems and Shaders. Thanks to a code
  contribution by Delight.

- Fixed a bug in the mipmap generation. Now mipmaps are not that blurry
  anymore and the rendering quality has been improved a lot.

- It is now possible to assign a userData int to callback functions of shaders. In this way it
  it easily possible to use the same callback method for multiple materials and distinguish
  between them during the call.

- Directional lights are now supported in the OpenGL and D3D drivers. To switch on directional
  lighting, set the light type to ELT_DIRECTIONAL in the SLight structure.

- Fixed several bugs in the GLSL implementation. Thanks to Michael Zoech for
  sending in his improvements.

- For the windows version of Irrlicht, the engine now displays an icon in the
  program window, if there is one available in the start path with the name "irr.ico".

- It is now possible to use images with alpha channels on buttons. Use the new
  IGUIButton::setUseAlphaChannel() method to enable this feature.

- The scene manager has a new method getSceneNodeFromName() which finds a scene node by its name.

- It is now also possible to attach scene nodes to joints/bones of sceletal animated .x files.
  (Using IAnimatedMesh->getXJointNode() ). This was previously only possible with milkshape models.

- Billboards now draw their bounding box when debugdata is set to visible for them.

- Lights now draw their bounding box and radius when debugdata is set to visible for them.

- Upgraded to irrXML 1.2. Thanks to some hints by Patrik M
